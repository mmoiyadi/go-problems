# pre-requisite
- Go installed on the system

# running tests
Inside each folder just execute the following command to run the tests. If the tests require any benchmarking like running within a specific time period, then execute the commands listed in commands.txt file in that folder
```
go test
```


Will keep updating as I solve more and more problems
